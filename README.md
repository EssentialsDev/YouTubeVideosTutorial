# Embedding YouTube Videos in Any IOS App

In this app I am going to show you how easy it is to embed YouTube videos. I am using a pod called YouTubePlayer in order to get the amazing results which is displayed in the app. In the old days you had to write tons of code in order to have get your YouTube video in the perfect position, and it still did not always work. In this app I will show you how easy it is to get your YouTube videos in your app, so it looks perfect. When you are developing you should adopt a very simple concept, why should you write code for something that someone else has already coded? This is the reason I always use CocoaPods. You can incorporate other peoples code in your app easily and for free.

If you have any questions on computer programming, or anything to do with programming please reach out to me on any of my social media accounts I would love to help. #the_kaseys
